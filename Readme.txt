// For a while I have been looking for the perfect ASP.Net MVC code.
// This is the cleanest code I have been able to write.
// I would like to challenge everyone to do better !!!
//
// By this I mean creating a better controller/views if possible codewise.
// The focus is not on the layout stuff, but having it might be a plus.
//
// The scope : a very rudimentary Task list (KISS)
//
// Some more info about my approach :
// It uses view models which contain both data and ActionLink references
// (like ICommand in WPF M-V-VM )
//
// You can download the full source here :
//     http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/tree/master/src/
//
// You will see it is very easy to alter, just download it and press F5
//
// Please do let me know what you think about my approach as well,
// and whether you could do better: ToJans@twitter
// Send this link to as much fellow coders as possible, so we can see lots of alternatives
//
// PS: you can also leave a comment @ my website (look at my twitter account)
